3. Getting Started

Upon launching Textractor, you'll be greeted with the main application window. Here's a quick overview of what you'll see:

- A large canvas on the left for displaying and interacting with your image.
- A preview pane on the right lets you view your extracted texture.
- Control buttons and options below the preview pane.

4. Main Interface

The main interface consists of several key areas:

- Menu Bar: Contains File and Help menus.
- Main Canvas: Displays the loaded image and allows for texture selection.
- Preview Pane: Shows the extracted texture with applied transformations.
- Control Panel: Contains buttons and options for various operations.
- Status Bar: Displays current application status and helpful messages.

5. Loading an Image

To load an image:

1. Click the "Load Image" button or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+O.
2. In the file dialog, navigate to and select your desired image.
3. Click "Open" to load the image.

The image will appear in the main canvas, ready for texture extraction.

6. Selecting a Texture

To select a texture from the loaded image:

1. Click on four points on the image to define your texture area.
2. The points should be selected in clockwise order, starting from the top-left corner of your desired texture.
3. A blue outline will appear, connecting your selected points to form a quadrilateral.

You can adjust the points by clicking and dragging them to refine your selection.

7. Adjusting Aspect Ratio

Textractor offers three aspect ratio modes:

- Estimated: Automatically calculates based on your selection.
- Square: Forces a 1:1 aspect ratio.
- Custom: Allows you to enter a specific aspect ratio. (May cause some issues with realtime updates to preview of texture)

To change the aspect ratio:

1. Select your desired mode from the "Aspect Ratio" dropdown.
2. Select "Custom" for custom ratios and enter the desired value (e.g., 16:9 would be 1.78).

8. Transforming the Texture

You can apply the following transformations to your extracted texture:

- Flip Vertically: Check the "Flip Vertically" box to flip the texture upside down.
- Flop Horizontally: Check the "Flop Horizontally" box to mirror the texture left to right.
- Rotate 90° Clockwise: Check the "Rotate 90° Clockwise" box to rotate the texture.

These transformations are applied in real-time and visible in the preview pane.

9. Extracting and Saving the Texture

Once you're satisfied with your selection and transformations:

1. The texture will be automatically extracted and displayed in the preview pane.
2. To save the texture, click the "Save Texture" button or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+S.
3. Choose a location, enter a filename, and select your desired file format (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, or BMP).

- Always preview your texture before saving to ensure it meets your requirements.
